# TJMod
The original trickjump modification for Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory.

First released April 13th, 2009.

Development of TJMod was stopped 2 years later in the middle of 2011.

After that it split off into:
- [ETRun](https://timeruns.net/) - Continuing the timerun part of TJMod ([source code](https://github.com/ETrun/ETrun))
- [ETJump](https://etjump.com/) - for *classic* ET trickjumping
